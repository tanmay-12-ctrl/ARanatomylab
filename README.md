# AR Anatomy Lab

AR Anatomy Lab is an Augmented Reality (AR) project designed to help medical students visualize human anatomy in 3D. This application provides an interactive experience, where students can explore key human organs like the heart, liver, brain, and kidney in AR through their devices.

## Project Overview

The AR Anatomy Lab project allows users to:
- View 3D models of human organs in augmented reality.
- Access information about each organ's functions via a user-friendly interface.
- Navigate between different organs by clicking on their corresponding 2D images.

### Key Features:
- 3D models of heart, liver, brain, and kidney.
- Simple UI for selecting organs from 2D images.
- Compatible with Android devices using Unity XR.

## How It Works

1. **Select an Organ:** Users can click on 2D images of organs displayed on the screen (heart, liver, brain, kidney).
2. **View in AR:** Once selected, a 3D model of the organ is displayed in AR for further exploration.
3. **Educational Information:** The application provides relevant information about each organ for learning purposes.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ARAnatomyLab.git
    ```

2. Open the project in **Unity** (version 2022.3.44f1 or later).

3. Ensure you have the **XR Plugin Management** installed and set up in your Unity project.

4. Build and deploy the project to your Android device.

## Requirements

- Unity 2022.3.44f1
- Android device with AR support
- XR Plugin Management installed in Unity

## Future Improvements

- Add rotation functionality for the 3D models to allow users to explore the organs from different angles.
- Include additional organs and systems for a more comprehensive anatomy study tool.
